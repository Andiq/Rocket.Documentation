Welcome to the RocketMod documentation!

!!! hint
    This documentation is in the works. Feel free to extend the documentation on GitHub.

RocketMod is an extensible .NET Game Server Plugin Framework.
It consists of two major parts - the Rocket Core - and some special implementations of its API for .NET Games.
The implementations act as a simple wrapper around the game's core functionality and support custom commands, configurations, and game objects. 

With a built-in permission system and growing plugin ecosystem RocketMod aims to become the middleware between the supported Games and Plugins altering gameplay by following the best .NET practices. 

This documentation contains useful information about how to **setup** a RocketMod server and it also covers the basics on how to **develop** custom plugins for the RocketMod Framework. 

To **download the latest version of RocketMod** head over to the [RocketMod GitHub release page](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned/releases).

For all officially approved RocketMod plugins, go to the [Reddit Repository List](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketmod/comments/ek4i7b/list_of_plugins_from_the_old_repository/).

Please feel free to extend or correct the documentation.

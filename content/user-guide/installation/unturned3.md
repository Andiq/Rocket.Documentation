## How to install RocketMod 5

> **WARNING**: Before installing RocketMod 5 please note that at the current time the build is unstable and could potentially damage your server.

We'll start by installing the lastest RocketMod 5 build from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RocketMod/rocket-unturned/build/artifacts) download the `Rocket.Unturned-5.0.0.xxx.zip`.
Once its installed open your servers Unturned directory and go to the `Modules` folder, extract the Rocket.Unturned zip into this modules folder.
After extracting run your server and all the required Rocket folders will be auto generated and you can start [installing plugins](https://rocketmod.guide/user-guide/plugins/installation/).
